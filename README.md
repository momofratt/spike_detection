Scripts for the analysis of spike from ICOS-ATC. Several modules and functions are defined to perform different analysis.
The script can run with every ICOS site datafile. Information for each site must be provided in the spikes_config.py file. 
The analysis needs minute data and results from spike detection algorithsm that are implemented by ICOS-ATC. These data are only internally available
